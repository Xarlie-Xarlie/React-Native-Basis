# First React Native App

## Application Funcionalities

- **`List your API repositories`**: You should be able to create a list of all repositories that are registered in your api with the fields **title**, **techs** and number of like following the pattern `Likes: ${repository.likes}`, just changing the number to be dynamic.

- **`Like a repository listed from the API`**: Must be able to like an item in your API through a button with the text **Like** and must update the number of like in the listing on mobile.

### Tests Especifications

- **`should add a like to the like counter of the repository`**: For this test to pass, your application must allow clicking on the `Like` button, a like to be added to the listed repository, and that update can be viewed on the screen.
